# Gun4Fun - PvE 2D Platform Game

A Unity Course Project to build a game from scratch. My team chose to clone a famous Flash game - Gun Mayhem. In this game, players will try to use their weapons to push others out of the map. The last man standing will become the winner. In the course's scope, we tried to implement Player vs Bot mode, apply physic and create several maps with different types of Bot.

Technologies

- Use tilemap & Custom Physic Shapes to create game maps and UI.  
- Use Colliders (Box, Circle, Tilemap,…) with RigridBody2D to simulate the physic world.  
- Use Projectile to create the environment's fx: dropping snow, rain, smoke,…  
- Use Package A* (Pathfinding) to build a bot in PvE mode  
- Use Tilemap Collider and Platform Effector 2D to create the One-way platform, which allows objects from below to jump up & land on the platform as well as drop down from the platform manually.  
- Use package Addressable Asset System to change sprites’ art in run-time
