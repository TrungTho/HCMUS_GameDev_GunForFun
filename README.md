# Gun4Fun - PvE 2D Platform Game

A Unity Course Project to build a game from scratch. My team chose to clone a famous Flash game - Gun Mayhem. In this game, players will try to use their weapons to push others out of the map. The last man standing will become the winner. In the course's scope, we tried to implement Player vs Bot mode, apply physic and create several maps with different types of Bot.
